A simple Pearson's correlation between average hospital procedure score and
average hospital survey score should give us an indication if these are
strongly linked.

Computing Pearson's we find a value of: 0.0968424687727
This suggests that there is not a strong correlation between survey responses
and overall quality of procedures at a hospital.
