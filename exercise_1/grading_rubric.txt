Grade the sections as follows:

1) correct folder structure: 1 point

Section 1: Loading and modeling:
2) load_data_lake.sh file present, 1 point
3) load_data_lake.sh runs without errors, 5 points
4) load_data_lake.sh places 2 or more files in HDFS, 5 points
5) hive_base_ddl.sql file present, 1 point
6) 2 or more tables created in hive_base_ddl, 3 points
7) hive_base_ddl.sql runs without error, creates all defined tables: 6 points
8) ER diagram present: 5 points
Total points in this section: 26

Section 2: Transforming
9) One file per entity in the ER diagram: 3 points, max 3
10) Each file runs correctly (as sql or python): 3 points per file, max 9
11) Each file creates a table that matches the entity in the ER diagram: 5 points per file, max 15
Total points in this section: 27

Section 3: Investigations
12) text and executable files per question: 1 point per file, 8 max
13) each executable runs correctly and produces output: 3 points each, 12 points max
14) each text file contains the same output as the executable produces
AND the rationale for the answer is sound: 3 points each, 12 max
Total points in this section: 32
