$git clone https://github.com/UC-Berkeley-I-School/w205-labs-exercises.git

The files are in the data/Crimes_-_2001_to_present_data directory.
Once you have the files (there should be seven of them, all starting with the
letter x), run the following commands (make sure you do not have otherfiles starting with
x in the directory). The first one will concatenate the split files into one file. The
original file was a compressed CSV file, so we name it appropriately. Next we uncompress
it to get the original CSV file. 

$ cat x* > Crimes_-_2001_to_present.csv.gz
$ gunzip Crimes_-_2001_to_present.csv.gz

The result should be that you have the Crime data CSV file in your directory. You
also still have the original split  files. If you run ls it should look something like
this:

$ ls
Crimes_-_2001_to_present.csv xac xaf
xaa xad xag
xab xae

You can check the correctness of the resulting files by checking the file size or
the number of rows in the file. The size may vary on different computers,
but the number of lines should remain the same.
$ du -s Crimes_-_2001_to_present.csv
2688712 Crimes_-_2001_to_present.csv
$ wc -l Crimes_-_2001_to_present.csv
5862796 Crimes_-_2001_to_present.csv

You could remove the split files using rm, but it is better to use the â€“i option so that
you do not accidentally remove other files in the directory that you want to save.

$ rm -i x*

At this point you should be able to see the Crime data file in your directory.

$ ls
Crimes_-_2001_to_present.csv
